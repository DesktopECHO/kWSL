  - Runs on Windows 10 / Windows Server 2019 and newer, including Hyper-V Core.

**IMPORTANT!** 
 - Windows 11 requires 22H2 Update *(Sun Valley 2, September 2022)*
 - Windows Server / Windows 10 require latest updates from Windows Update.

## INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
From an elevated CMD.EXE prompt change to your desired install directory and type/paste the following command:

```
PowerShell -executionpolicy bypass -command "wget https://github.com/DesktopECHO/kWSL/raw/master/kWSL.cmd -UseBasicParsing -OutFile kWSL.cmd ; .\kWSL.cmd"
```

You will be asked a few questions.  The install script will determine current DPI scaling, or set your own value if preferred:

```
[kWSL Installer 20210609]

Enter a unique name for your kWSL distro or hit Enter to use default.
Keep this name simple, no space or underscore characters [kWSL]: Neon
Port number for xRDP traffic or hit Enter to use default [3399]: 13399
Port number for SSHd traffic or hit Enter to use default [3322]: 13322
Set a custom DPI scale, or hit Enter for Windows default [1.5]: 1.25
[Not recommended!] Type X to eXclude from Windows Defender:

Installing kWSL Distro [Neon] to "C:\WSL Distros\Neon"
This will take a few minutes, please wait...
```

The installer will download all the necessary packages to transform the [Jammy base image](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/jammy/current/) into KDE Neon User Edition.  Reference times will vary depending on system performance and the presence of antivirus software.  A fast system/network can complete the install in about 10 minutes.

  - xRDP Server listening on port 13399 and SSHd on port 13322.

  - Links for GUI and Console sessions have been placed on your desktop.

  - (Re)launch init from the Task Scheduler or by running the following command:
    schtasks /run /tn Neon

 Neon Installation Complete!  GUI will start in a few seconds...
```

**When the script completes you will be logged-in to your KDE Neon Desktop.** 

## Configure kWSL to start at boot (like a service, no console window)

 - Right-click the task in Task Scheduler, click properties
 - Click the checkbox for **Run whether user is logged on or not** and click **OK**
 - Enter your Windows credentials when prompted
 
 Reboot your PC when complete and kWSL will startup automatically.

## Convert WSL Instance

Example of conversion to WSL2:
 - Stop WSL instance (Using default instance name _NeonWSL_ in this example):
 ````wslconfig /t NeonWSL````
 - Convert the instance to WSL2:
 ````wsl --set-version NeonWSL 2````
 - Restart KDE Neon Instance:
 ````schtasks /run /tn NeonWSL````

Restart the instance when the conversion is complete: `schtasks.exe /run /tn NeonWSL`

Procedure is the same for switching back to WSL1: ````wsl --set-version NeonWSL 1````

## Make it your own

From a security standpoint, it would be best to fork this project so you (and only you) control the packages and files in the repository.

- Sign into GitHub and fork this project
- Edit ```kWSL.cmd```.  On line 2 you will see ```SET GITORG=DesktopECHO``` - Change ```DesktopECHO``` to the name of your own repository.
- Customize the script any way you like.
- Launch the script using your repository name:
 ```PowerShell -executionpolicy bypass -command "wget https://github.com/YOUR-REPO-NAME/kWSL/raw/master/kWSL.cmd -UseBasicParsing -OutFile kWSL.cmd ; .\kWSL.cmd"```

## Quirks / Limitations / Additional Info:

- H.264 Enabled in XRDP
- Kwin desktop composition is enabled by default 
- When you log out out of a KDE session the WSL instance is restarted.  This is the equivilent to having a freshly-booted desktop environment at every login, but the 'reboot' process only takes about 5 seconds.  
- kWSL should work fine with an X Server instead of xRDP but this has not been thoroughly tested.  The file ```/etc/profile.d/kWSL.sh``` contains WSL-centric environment variables that may need adjustment such as LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT.
- Plasma-discover doesn't work in Server 2019 / Win 10 v.1809 -- The installer will remove it if you're running an affected OS. 
- WSL1 Doesn't work with PolicyKit.  Enabled kdesu/gksu for apps needing elevated rights (plasma-discover, ksystemlog, muon, root console.)    
- KDE Lockscreen is not implemented (due to policykit)  
- Patched KDE Activity Manager to disable WAL in sqlite3. 
- Mozilla Seamonkey is included as a stable/maintained browser. 
- QtWebEngine (Chromium-based) browsers like Falkon and Konqueror now work. (July/21)
- Installed image consumes approximately 3 GB of disk space.
- Apt-fast added to improve download speed and reliability.
- Default installation uses the Breeze theme and Windows fonts (Segoe UI / Cascadia Code)
- Includes the [Klassy](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/wju5g9/klassy_v40_window_decoration_application_style/) window decoration / application style plugin
- This is a basic installation of KDE to save bandwidth.  If you want the **complete** KDE Desktop environment (+3GB Disk) run ```sudo pkcon -y install neon-all```
